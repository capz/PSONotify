This repo is an archive, it has not been worked on since the PSO2 launcher included similar functionality a few years ago.

features:
- check a twitter account for messages announcing emergency quests for a specific server
- process the chat logs coming from PSO2 and detect specific strings and interpret them as commands for the notification app
- shows as notification balloons any emergency quests using pso2 sound effects
- configurable how/what/when you want the app to inform you
- starts with windows, if you want it to
